# Worldwide Company Layoffs Analysis

## Description

This project aims to seek insights into data involving employee layoffs of approximately 1600 different companies from various countries around the world from March 2020-March 2023. SQL is used to clean the data as well as for performing exploratory data analysis. The goal of the analysis 
was to uncover any potential patterns or areas of interest in the companies that were laying off employees, particularly at the maximums where companies saw the highest amount of layoffs compared to other companies. Analysis was also performed
on the dates of when employees were laid off, as well as what industry sectors these companies belonged to. The main questions sought to answer were:

- Which companies in general saw the most layoffs?
- What parts of the world saw the most layoffs?
- Which industry sectors saw the most layoffs?
- At what times were there a lot of layoffs?

## Insights

The first part of the EDA was to determine which companies saw 100% of their employees be layed off. There were many companies in this dataset that appeared to "go under", though it was determined that the construction company Katerra was the largest company
(measured by number of employees laid off) to layoff 100% of it's 2,434 employees. In terms of sheer total employees laid off though, it was Amazon who saw the most with a total of 18,150 employees laid off; 51% higher than 2nd place Google.

Next was to determine which parts of the world saw the highest number of layoffs. In this dataset, the United States was in a league of it's own with 256,420 total layoffs, followed by India with just 35,793 in comparison. When zooming in on which cities saw
the most layoffs, it was found that the San Fransisco Bay Area saw the highest by far with 125,551 layoffs. New York City and Seattle rounded out the top 3 with 34,743 and 29,364 layoffs respectively. Bengaluru was 4th with 21,587 making it the city with the
largest number of layoffs outside the USA.
